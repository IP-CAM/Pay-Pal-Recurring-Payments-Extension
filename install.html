   <h2>Installtion Instructions</h2>
   <p><strong>In order to successfully install the extension please follow these instructions:</strong></p>
   <ul>
    <li>If you have not installed VQMOD for your opencart you must do this first, else the extension will not work and you will recieve errors. You can download it here: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/vqmod/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/vqmod/</a></li>
      <li>If you have not installedan SSL you need to do so. Purchase a cheap SSL from your hosting company and just get it taken care of. Paypal Website Payments Pro requires it.</li>
   <li>Unzip the extension to a location on your local drive that will not conflict with any other OpenCart files.</li>
   <li>With FTP, upload the entire contents of the UPLOAD folder to your store location. Nothing will be over-written.</li>
   <li>Login to your admin www.yourdomain.com/admin and navigate to EXTENSIONS>PAYMENTS>PayPal Website Payment Pro (Recurring) and click on INSTALL. When you do this, the extension will install itself along with all of the SQL queries needed to allow it to function.</li>
   <li>Now navigate to CATALOG>PRODUCTS and set up your recurring items. If you are going to run a trial then this is where you want to set that up as well. The 3 custom fields you want to pay attention to are under the DATA TAB in product details.</li>
   <li>Now, navigate to EXTENSIONS>PAYMENTS>PayPal Website Payment Pro (Recurring) and click EDIT. You will see many TABS of items to configure. You will want to read the information in the OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION TAB to get a better understanding on how to use the system.</li>
